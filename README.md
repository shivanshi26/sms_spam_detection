# sms_spam_detection
1.A SMS spam detection project aims to develop a system that can automatically identify and filter out unsolicited or spam text messages in real-time.

2.The model will be trained on a labeled dataset of SMS messages, distinguishing between spam and legitimate texts, and then integrated into a mobile application or messaging platform for real-time spam detection and prevention.

Goals:

Spam Identification: Create a model capable of accurately distinguishing between spam and legitimate text messages.

Real-time Processing: Develop a system that can process incoming SMS messages in real-time, categorizing them as spam or not.
